# Dungeon Maker Web Server
A web server designed for use with [Dungeon Maker](https://github.com/zelitzsi/dungeonmaker). Supports very simple user auth with a text database, which was used for ease of setup and ability to easily modify the database; it would not be suitable for a production version.
